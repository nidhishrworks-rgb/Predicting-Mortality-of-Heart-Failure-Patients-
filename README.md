## 📝 Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to predict the survival probability of patients with heart failure. By analyzing clinical features such as serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and age, the model identifies high-risk patients to assist in clinical decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
* **Model:** Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Key Visualizations
* **Correlation Heatmap:** Identifying the strongest relationships between clinical factors and mortality.
* **Feature Importance:** Highlighting that 'Serum Creatinine' and 'Ejection Fraction' are the top predictors.
